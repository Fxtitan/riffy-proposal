PLAN/PROPOSAL/OUTLINE

App summary/logic - My app will equip you with the information you need to help you build a vehicle.
Such as which vehicle you may or may not want to build, a budget so that your pockets aren't left empty, and lastly a time frame of when the vehicle will be done so that you are able to plan your vacation time without any hiccups. My app will give you a vehicle based on a personality trait. You will have the ability to give the app a number for your budget and you will receive a foundation of the build. Lastly, the let us know if you have any big upcoming plans or what your daily schedule is like and the app will help you with time management. 

Stretch Goals
I would like for my app to be able to take in the color the user picks along with the way the body looks so 
that the user can see the finished project on the app before they even start.
